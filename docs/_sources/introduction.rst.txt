What is PyGran?
***************
*PyGran* is an object-oriented library written primarily in Python for Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation and analysis. The main purpose of *PyGran*  is to provide an easy and intuitive way for performing technical computing in DEM, enabling flexibility in how users interact with data from the onset of a simulation and until the post-processing stage. In addition to providing a brief tutorial on installing *PyGran*  for Unix systems, this manual focuses on 2 core modules (:numref:`fig_pygran`) in *PyGran* : ``simulation`` which provides ``engines`` for running DEM simulation and enables analysis of contact mechanical models, and ``analysis`` which contains methods and modules for processing DEM data. *PyGran*  is released under the GNU General Public License (`GPL v2.0 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html>`_), and its code base is available from `github <https://www.github.com/Andrew-AbiMansour/PyGran>`_.

Brief summary of DEM
####################
The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is the application of Newtonian mechanics to a set of interacting particles that are usually assumed to be spherical in shape. For a spherical particle :math:`i` that undergoes translation and rotation and of moment of inertia :math:`I_i` and volume :math:`V_i`, its dynamical equations are

.. math::
   \rho V_i a_i &= \sum_j F_{ij} + F_{b_i},

   I_i \alpha_i &= \sum_j T_{ij}.

The true mass density of the particles is :math:`\rho`, :math:`F_{ij}` is the surface contact force between particle :math:`i` and its neighbors (summed over :math:`j`), :math:`F_{b_i}` is a body force acting on particle :math:`i` (such as gravity, i.e. :math:`F_{b_i} = \rho V_i g`), and :math:`T_{ij}` is the torque between particle :math:`i` and its neighbors that is limited by the static friction coefficient :math:`\mu`.

DEM simulation involves the numerical solution of Eqs. (1) by decomposing the space the particles occupy into a grid of connected nearest-neighbor lists that enable fast and efficient computation of inter-particle surface forces. For every discrete timestep, all forces acting on each particle are computed, and the particle positions are updated based on the discretized form of Eqs. (1).

    A flowchart that shows the different stages involved in completing a single DEM timestep.

The form of the surface contact forces depends on the type of the bodies interacting with each other. Visco-elastic particles for instance can be modeled as two connected spring-dashpots. More sophisticated models assume particles behave as elasto-plastic spheres that undergo plastic deformation when the pressure exceeds a yield stress characteristic of the material the particles are composed of. Irrespective of the method energy dissipation is modeled, DEM usually assumes the two spherical particles in contact experience an elastic repulsive force that follows Hertz' law. In addition to dissipation, the particles can experience an attractive cohesive force depending on their size. The contact models implemented in *PyGran* are discussed in the :doc:`simulation` pat. For a comprehensive review of DEM and contact mechanics, see :cite:`poschel2005computational`. 

As of version 1.1, *PyGran* supports non-spherical particle simulation with the multisphere method (MS-DEM) :cite:`kruggel2008study`. In this method, non-spherical particles are approximated by a series of spheres glued together as shown in :numref:`fig_multisphere`.

    In DEM, particles are usually represented as spheres (right); non-spherical particles (such as a rod, left) can be approximated with a group of glued spheres

Prerequisites
#############
OS support
**********
In the current version, *PyGran* is configured to run on Unix or Unix-like operating systems. While *PyGran* can be run on a Windows platform, it has not yet been fully tested. *PyGran* supports Python 3.X and is fully backwards compatible with Python 2.2 (and later verions). The table in :doc:`index` summarizes some of the technical details of the *PyGran* source code.

Dependencies
************
Core packages
-------------
*PyGran* is designed to work in conjunction with *NumPy*, *SciPy*, and other Python libraries. The following packages must be installed before *PyGran* is configured to run:

    `Numpy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy>`_: for exposing trajectory data as ``ndarray`` objects and performing linear algebra floating-point operations

    `Scipy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy>`_: for efficient nearest neighbor searching routines, sorting, and non-linear solvers

Optional packages
-----------------
For running DEM simluation with `LIGGGHTS <https://www.cfdem.com/liggghts-open-source-discrete-element-method-particle-simulation-code>`_ :cite:`kloss2011liggghts` in parallel, OpenMPI or MPICH2 must be installed on the system. The packages are needed to achieve full optimal functionality in *PyGran* are:

    `Cython <https://github.com/cython/cython>`_: for improved performance in ``analysis.core`` module

    `mpi4py <https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py>`_: for running DEM simulation in parallel with MPI

    `vtk <https://pypi.org/project/vtk>`_: for reading input files in VTK file format

    `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_: for generating 2D plots

    `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil>`_ : for XRCT image analysis

If *PyGran* is installed via the Python Package Index (`PyPi <https://pypi.org>`_), then all of the core dependencies will be installed as well. However, for optimal performance, it is recommended that cython is installed on the system. How to setup and install *PyGran* is explained in the next section.

Installation
############
Quick installation with PyPi
****************************
The easiest way to install the latest stable version of *PyGran* is with PyPi::

    pip install pygran --user

Similarly one could use pip3 to install *PyGran* for Python 3.X. For optimal and full performance, gcc and OpenMPI/MPICH2 must be installed (on Linux)::

    pip install cython pygran --user

Stable source code
******************
Even though *git* is not required to install or run *PyGran*, its availability makes it easier and convenient to download the latest version of the source code via::

    git clone git@github.com:Andrew-AbiMansour/PyGran.git

This clones the repository to a directory called `PyGran`::

    cd PyGran

For updating an existing repository, *git* can be used to sync the source code with the online repository via::

    git pull origin master

Alternatively, one can download the source code as a tar ball (or zip file) from `github <https://www.github.com>`_, and then manually extract the files.
*PyGran* uses Python's `setuptools` to check for and/or download dependencies. For building *PyGran*, run from the ``PyGran`` directory::

    python setup.py build

For a local installation, run from the ``PyGran`` directory::

    python setup.py install --user

For a comprehensive list of options on running `setup.py`, see the doc strings in setuptools.

Development source code
***********************
An experimental version of the code can be downloaded from `github <https://andrew-abimansour.github.io/PyGran>`_ and then installed using the method described in the `Stable source code`_ subsection, except the branch to pull the source code from is ``develop``::

    git checkout develop

*PyGran* can then be installed following the steps outlined previously.

Configuration with *LIGGGHTS*
*********************************
*PyGran* has been tested with `LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC <https://www.cfdem.com/download-liggghtsr-public>`_ versions 3.4, 3.7, and 3.8. For running DEM simulation with *LIGGGHTS*, the latter must be compiled as a shared library (shared object on Unix/Linux systems), which *PyGran* will attempt to find. By default, *PyGran* searches for any available installation of ``libliggghts.so`` and writes its path name to the 1st line in ``PyGran/modules/.config``. *PyGran* will also attempt to find the *LIGGGHTS* version and source path, and write each to the 2nd and 3rd lines, respectively, in the .config file. Alternatively, in case multiple versions are installed on the system or if the library filename is not ``libliggghts.so``, users can specify the name of the shared object and optionally its source code path and version via::

    import PyGran

    PyGran.configure(
        path='/home/user/.local/lib/custom_libliggghts.so',
        version='3.8.0',
        src='/path/to/LIGGGHTS-3.8.0/src'
    )

This produces a ``.config`` file for *LIGGGHTS* v3.8 shown below::

    library=/home/user/.local/lib/custom_libliggghts.so
    src=/path/to/LIGGGHTS-3.8.0/src
    version=3.8.0

If ``.config`` file is not found, *PyGran* will create one.

Compiling LIGGGHTS
******************
*PyGran*'s setup enables the compilation of *LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC* from its source code on `github <https://github.com/CFDEMproject/LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC>`_ via::
    
    python setup.py build_liggghts

The command above will clone the *LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC* repository and compile the code as a shared library (``libliggghts.so``) in ``LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC/src``. This requires *git*, *gcc*, and an MPI installation available on the system.

Installation example: ubuntu 18.04 (LTS)
****************************************
The section below demonsrates a fresh local installation of PyGran & LIGGGHTS form source code. They have been tested with python 3, gcc v7.x, and LIGGGHTS v3.8. For global installs, remove ``--user`` from the commands and use ``sudo`` instead.

First, fire up a terminal in order to update the system and install all dependencies via::

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc libopenmpi-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip ipython3 git python3-matplotlib libvtk6-dev -y

Let's now clone the PyGran  source code::

    git clone https://github.com/Andrew-AbiMansour/PyGran.git
    cd PyGran

Let's locally install PyGran dependencies with pip3::

    pip3 install -e .[extra] --user

In order to compile LIGGGHTS, run::

    python3 setup.py build_liggghts

This will clone the *LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC* repository and compile the code as a shared object. The process takes a few minutes to finish. Once this is done, we can finally install PyGran::

    pip3 install . --user

Testing PyGran
**************
Let's run a simple compaction problem in order to make sure everything works fine. Open a terminal and run from anywhere::

    mpirun python3 -m PyGran.demo DEM flow

The mpirun command above should take about 1-5 mins to finish, depending on the core clock cycle and how many cores are available on the system. If successful, this command should create an output directory ('out-SpringDashpot-date-of-creation') which contains the trajectory and restart files stored in 'traj' and 'restart' directories, respectively.
